        <p>
          I&apos;m a second-year Computing & Innovation student at the University of
          Adelaide, passionate about creating useful and interesting tools and
          websites. Blending curiosity with logic, I enjoy tackling challenges
          that push me to grow while keeping my code clean and human-readable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I&apos;m at my best when I&apos;m learning by doing, collaborating with
          teammates, or finding smarter ways to solve problems. Outside of
          coding, you can catch me deep in a chess match or immersed in a video
          game world.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Curious, logical, and a true team playerâ€”I&apos;m now seeking internship
          opportunities where I can contribute my skills, gain hands-on
          experience, and keep leveling up as a developer.
